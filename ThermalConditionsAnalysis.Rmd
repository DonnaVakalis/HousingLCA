This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
##### PRE-AMBLE: 
  ##### Setup: pre- (condition 0) and post-retrofit (condition 1) indoor thermal comfort are each dependent on the independent variable outdoor temperature, for each building. 
  ##### Goal: 
    # 1) we want to know if pre- and post-retrofit (condition 0 and 1) are significantly different from one another
    # 2) we want to visualize each of the pre- and post-retrofit thermal comfort (on y axis) versus outdoor temp (x axis) on same graph
  ##### Approach: have a global model that codes for condition 0 and condition 1 as variables, i.e., 'dummy variable', always in response to outdoor temp variable; then look for 'effect size' of condition 0 versus condition 1... 
    # 3) repeat steps 1 and 2 for each building: because they had different retrofit actions and other unmeasured differences
```


```{r} 
  ##### Install and load libraries
library(readstata13) #to read in old stata file(s) with thermal and temp data
library(readr) #to read csv files
library(tidyverse) #for everything 
library(dplyr) #for everything 
```

```{r}
  ##### Get data and create dataframe
    # 1) Get outdoor temp by date
    # 2) Get indoor thermal comfort by date 
    # 3) Categorize outdoor and indoor data into pre and post  
    # 4) Make a single dataframe with columns: pre/post, outdoor temp, indoor thermal condition, building, suite*, date* 
    #   *suite and date will not be used in analysis but will be useful for quick checks and other possible investigations of interest e.g., matching survey data with thermal conditions 

# 1) Get outdoor temp by date:

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
