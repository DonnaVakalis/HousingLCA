# HousingLCA Project Overview
Analysis of weather, indoor environment, thermal comfort in social housing retrofits
 
## Motivation
To analytically explore changes to surveyed and modeled thermal comfort as well as life cycle carbon from various retrofits to social housing. 
The retrofitted buildings are seven multi-unit residential buildings, a building type that has potential for improvement in terms of energy-use and indoor environmental conditions.
